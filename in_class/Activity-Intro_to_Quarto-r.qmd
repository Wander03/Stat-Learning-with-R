2.  Find something that all of you enjoy for fun. Insert a related picture or meme below.

3.  Each of you, choose a favorite color from [this list](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf). Each of you share how comfortable you are with R on a scale of 1-10.

Edit the code below so that it has your names and corresponding comfort levels.

```{r}
#| label: group_info-r
group_data <- tibble(
  names = c("Andrew", "Daniel", "Brenden"),
  colors = c("turquoise4", "dodgerblue4", "cornflowerblue"),
  comfort = c(9, 7, 8)
)
```

4.  Click "Render" and see the plot that is produced.

(Do not edit the code chunk below!)

```{r group_plot}
#| label: plot-r
#| fig-cap: "Our comfort levels with R"
group_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = names, y = comfort, fill = names)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = group_data$colors)
```
